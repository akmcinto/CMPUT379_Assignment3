Procnanny:
Procnanny monitors running processes and kills them if they run for longer than a 
specified amount of time.  Procnanny takes one input, which is a file with where 
each line lists a process to be monitored and the number of seconds it should be
monitored for.  At any time a SIGHUP signal can be sent to the parent process to
cause the configuration file to be re-read.  To terminate the procnanny program, 
at any time a SIGINT signal can be sent to the parent process which will cause 
procanny to cleanly exit and kill all its children, even if they are monitoring a 
process at the time.  If a process is being monitored when SIGINT is recieved, it 
will NOT be killed and will no longer be terminated after the amount of time specified
in the configuration file has elapsed.  Information is written to a log file, whose 
location is specified by the enviornmental variable PROCNANNYLOGS. If specifying the 
logfile enviornment variable as a full path, it must be started with "/home/user" 
(using "~" will not work).

An executable called "procnanny" is generated by calling "make".  This executable can
be removed by calling "make clean".  The program can be run by calling "./procnanny 
input_file_name". Or, use "export PATH=$PATH:." then "procnanny input_file_name" (this
removes the "./" from the function call).
